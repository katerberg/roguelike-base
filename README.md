# Roguelike Base

A framework to allow building a traditional roguelike easily.

## Local development

To run the app locally and start modifying it to build your own roguelike, run the following to get a working (fairly boring) Roguelike running on https://localhost:8080

```
nvm use
npm i
npm start
```
